Any data obtained through the Google APIs will only be used for issuing certificates via our add-on and will not be shared with third-party applications.

#Information We Collect

Our Google Form Add-on uses a minimum amount of scopes, including two default scopes provided by Google and three additional scopes provided by Google Forms Script Editor.
These scopes allow us to access specific data and perform necessary actions within the add-on, such as creating and issuing certificates based on the responses provided by users in their Google Form submissions.

The scopes used in our Google Form Add-on include:

Google Sheets Scope: This scope allows us to read and write data to the Google Sheet that is associated with the Google Form. 
                     We use this scope to retrieve user responses and insert the certificate data into the sheet.
Google Drive Scope: This scope allows us to create and access files in the user's Google Drive account. 
                    We use this scope to create and store the certificate files that are generated by our add-on.
Google Forms Scope: This scope allows us to read and write data to the Google Form that is associated with the add-on. 
                    We use this scope to retrieve user responses and update the form status to indicate that the certificate has been issued.
                    
Our Google Form Add-on does not collect any personal information from users other than the information required for authentication and issuing certificates.
We only obtain information from users who have signed up for our services through our company configurations in the Google add-on after installation.
